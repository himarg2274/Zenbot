### Project Description
The chatbot platform, accessible through a website, features three unique character bots—Calm, Motivational, and Friendly Roaster. Depending on the user's input, the bot adapts its response to provide personalized support. The Calm bot offers soothing, reassuring responses, the Motivational bot gives uplifting and encouraging advice, and the Friendly Roaster adds a touch of humor with light-hearted roasts, all tailored to the user's emotional state.

### Project Description
The chatbot platform, accessible through a website, features three unique character bots—Calm, Motivational, and Friendly Roaster. Depending on the user's input, the bot adapts its response to provide personalized support. The Calm bot offers soothing, reassuring responses, the Motivational bot gives uplifting and encouraging advice, and the Friendly Roaster adds a touch of humor with light-hearted roasts, all tailored to the user's emotional state.

### The Problem statement
In a world where people often struggle with feelings of loneliness and isolation, having someone to talk to can make a significant difference. However, not everyone has access to supportive listeners at critical moments. Whether it’s due to social stigma, busy schedules, or difficulty finding someone they trust, people often feel isolated with no outlet to share their thoughts and emotions. This lack of connection can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and even depression.

### The Solution
ZenBot aims to bridge this gap by providing a compassionate, AI-driven conversational companion that adapts to the user’s emotional needs, offering personalized interactions, empathetic responses, and constructive guidance to improve emotional well-being. ZenBot keeps users engaged by offering conversations tailored to their mood and preferences. It features dynamic personas like calm, motivational, or humorous styles to suit user needs. Its 24/7 availability ensures users always have someone to talk to.
